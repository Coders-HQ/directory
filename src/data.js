Most people refer to me as a workaholic. But in reality, I'm incredibly passionate about bringing as much benefit to the world as possible. My main interests lie in Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity, and Embedded Systems. Teaching is one of my biggest passions, and I take great pride in giving my students the best education possible. After all, they're the ones that are going to be advancing our society as it is today. And it's not about work all the time, either. I love hanging out with my friends and having fun, which is equally important. The biggest life lesson I've learned to date is to try and use your shortcomings to your advantage. It's a highly underestimated technique, but I assure you that it pays off incredibly well ;)",
